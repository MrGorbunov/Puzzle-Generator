	[ ] Also maybe have multiple caches for different annotation layers

[x] Main menu
[ ] Create Sample levels to test solver with
	[x] Read from levels directory

[ ] Parse levels with buffered reader instead of giant string

[~] Graph generation
	[x] Use LevelState for game logic
	[ ] Keep sorted array (object) of previous states instead of memo array

[ ] Annotations
	[ ] Edges for possible moves
	[ ] Strongly connected components
	[ ] Moves internal to component
	[ ] Accessible components
	[ ] Whether it's still solvable
	[ ] Check whether level is solvable

[ ] Stepping through search process
[ ] Showing ghosts?
[ ] Level Annotation (for procGen)
